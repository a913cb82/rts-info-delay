# Growth rework (2026-09-13)

Town growth is now an **agrarian economy**: land- and labour-limited
farming, conservative food trade, food-limited births, surplus-labour
migration, and market services. This doc is the one place for the
model, the parameters (all real-world quantities) and the sanity
results. The earlier fitted realism model (2026-09-12, `a/K/c` +
access/migration kernels) is superseded; its suite still runs via
`benchmarks/growth_realism.py --system fitted` and the plot at
`docs/realism_plots/realism_fit.png`.

## Constants (geography / game)

| symbol | config | value | real-world meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `R` | `farm_radius_km` | 5 | farm walking radius — nobody farms further |
| `rho` | `rural_density` | 30 /km² | subsistence rural density (England/France c.1600) |
| `Lc` | `cart_distance_km` | 20 | distance over which carting doubles grain price |
| — | `turns_per_year` | 52 | 1 turn = 1 week |
| `sf` | `farm_workers_yield` | 1.3 | people fed per farm worker |
| `b` | `birth_rate` | 35 /1000/yr | crude birth rate |
| `m` | `death_rate` | 31 /1000/yr | crude death rate (`b−m` = 0.4%/yr) |
| `sm` | `market_premium` | 0.25 | max farm-output premium from market services |
| `th` | `migration_share` | 0.5 | share of natural increase that emigrates |
| `nu` | `surplus_mobility` | 0.05 /yr | share of surplus labour that emigrates |
| `Lm` | `migration_scale_km` | 50 | migration distance scale |
| — | `town_min_population` | **10** | minimum settlement size (die at or below) |

Derived: `Y_ring = rho·πR²` ≈ 2356 people (one ring's food), `h = b/m − 1` ≈ 0.13.

## Formulae (per turn)

```
curves      win(d;D) = sig(D^2/d^2 - D^2/(D^2-d^2))     D = info_speed
            c(d)     = 2^(-d/Lc) in reach, 0 beyond 3·Lc (~60 km)

land        area_i = Voronoi cell within R (nearest-farmer, sampled)
serv_j  = max(0, P_j - Y_j/sf)                          non-farm population
mkt_i   = sum_j serv_j * c(d_ij)
boost_i = sm * mkt_i/(mkt_i + P_i)                      services per head served
Y_i     = (1 + boost_i) * min(rho*area_i, sf*P_i)       production

trade       surplus_j = max(0, Y_j - P_j); deficit_i = max(0, P_i - Y_i)
            greedy nearest-first with hard caps (conservative)
            S_i = Y_i + imports_i                       food commanded

births      B_i = b*P_i * S_i/(S_i + h*P_i)             f=1 -> births=deaths
deaths      D_i = m*P_i

migration   out_i   = th*max(0,B_i-D_i) + nu*max(0, P_i - Y_i/sf)
            attr_ij = max(0,P_j-P_i) * min(1,S_j/P_j) * e^(-d/Lm) * win(d)
            flow_ij = out_i * attr_ij / sum_k attr_ik
            net_ij  = flow_ij - flow_ji

update      P_i' = P_i + B_i - D_i + sum_j net_ij
```

Conservation: trade ships each surplus unit once (`Σimports = Σexports`,
unreached surplus simply not eaten); migration is origin-budgeted and
antisymmetric (people only move). Only births and deaths change the
total. Exact stacks keep the engine rule (smaller dies, larger ignores).

## Sanity results (3 archetype runs)

**Lone settlements** (3,000 turns ≈ 58 yrs):

| start | end | %/yr |
|---|---|---|
| village 300 | 315 | +0.08 |
| town 2,400 | 2,392 | −0.01 |
| city 20,000 | 10,448 | −1.12 |

**Equal population (4,200) in one 120 km region** (10,000 turns):

| structure | end | %/yr |
|---|---|---|
| 14 villages × 300 | 4,936 | +0.084 |
| 10 villages + 1,200 town | 4,936 | +0.084 |
| 6 villages + 2,400 town | 4,600 | +0.047 |
| 3 villages + 3,300 town | 4,222 | +0.003 |
| 1 town 4,200 | 3,061 | −0.164 |

**City systems, equal population 20,400 within carting range** (20,000 turns):

| structure | end | %/yr |
|---|---|---|
| 68 villages | 28,177 | +0.084 |
| **1×2,400 town + 60 villages** | **30,319** | **+0.103** |
| 1×4,800 town + 52 villages | 29,457 | +0.096 |
| 1×8,400 town + 40 villages | 27,428 | +0.077 |
| 1×12,000 town + 28 villages | 21,052 | +0.008 |
| 1 city 20,400 | 3,268 | −0.475 |

Findings: a **low urban fraction** (~12% market town) pays for itself
through market services and beats pure villages (+0.103 vs +0.084 %/yr);
oversized towns/cities starve and drag the system down; a 2,400 town is
already too big for only 1,800 rural neighbours. Towns are population
sinks (natural growth 0 when fed — they live on migration), which is
the intended urban-graveyard behaviour.

`sanity_agrarian_struct.py`, `sanity_agrarian_city.py`.


### Town size and the farmland packing limit

A settlement's ring is `πR² ≈ 79 km²`. Within a town's carting reach
(`3·L_cart ≈ 60 km`) at most `π·60²/79 ≈ 144` villages fit without
overlapping farmland — 118 at 10 km hex spacing, which is the realistic
packing. One town replaces one lattice site; one-turn rates (turn 2,
services primed), 117 villages around it:

| town seed | young villages (300 pop, surplus 90) | mature villages (1,800, surplus 540) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | +0.084 | +0.084 |
| 2,400 | +0.101 | +0.089 |
| 4,800 | **+0.113** | +0.102 |
| 9,600 | +0.107 | +0.113 |
| 14,400 | +0.098 | — |
| 24,000 | +0.083 | **+0.117** |
| 48,000 | — | +0.111 |

The optimal town is not a fixed 2,400: it scales with the villages'
**marketable surplus**, because the same service premium is a
percentage of a much larger harvest once farmland is full. Young
countryside (117 × 90 ≈ 10k surplus) supports towns up to ~10k with an
optimum near 5k; mature countryside (117 × 540 ≈ 63k surplus) supports
cities of tens of thousands with an optimum near 24k. That is the urban
transition: towns grow as the countryside matures.

Method note: one turn (two with the market-service lag) gives the
instantaneous rate and the equilibrium direction; long runs are only
needed to quantify slow accumulation effects like town growth.

## Status / open items

- Engine tests + integration are green; 9 bot-side tests still encode
  the old economy and are the bot agent's remit (`tests/bots/`).
- The realism suite (`growth_realism.py --system engine`) now measures
  the agrarian model through a compatibility adapter; its scores are
  not re-fitted yet (the suite was built for the fitted model).
- Calibration knobs with priors: `market_premium` (0.05–0.5, anchor
  `market_access_ratio`), `farm_workers_yield` (1.2–1.5),
  `surplus_mobility` and `migration_share`.
