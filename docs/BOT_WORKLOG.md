## Log

### Pro — best-of-all assembly (2026-09-04)
Fast: endgame 2245→3249 (counter-punch breaks mirror), opening 3240→4316,
defense 1109 (holds). Slow: efficiency 59%→100% (P3b empty-field hold =
policy optimum exactly), succession 0→611, snowball 3748→5681,
attrition/endurance restored to 4226/3089 after P5-P7 scares.
Elo: all-draws (structural at 3000/60t); pro concedes nothing.
Doctrine learned:
- P2 counter-punch (hold-all vs peer field armies, counter the spent foe)
  breaks mirrors; marching the pack out naked re-loses the race (1647).
- Rope is duel-only (P5): in big wars release never fires → slow death
  (attrition 4226→1900); there, departure-sync/pressure.
- Home defense is duel-only (P6): holding one home bleeds long wars
  (endurance 6424→904); there, all-out.
- Viability gate is duel-only (P7, biggest save): denial-raids erase foe
  production in big wars; gating cost 2185 (endurance 904→3089). Ported
  to greedy + aggressive.
- Endurance 6424-baseline vs 3089-now conflates pro + opponent improvements
  (foes are tougher); honest pro-delta is 3089→3089 with better duels.
- Takes in symmetric endgames still missing (out-settles 3v4 but doesn't
  crack); needs siege craft (future).

### Expander — guard + working settlers (2026-09-04)
Fast: guard 1000→1624 (capital HELD + settle), settle/chain flat (correct).
Elo: expander now holds vs greedy+aggressive (was: taken) — see doctrine.
Doctrine learned:
- Same latent note_move bug as greedy (settlers sat on sites); fixed.
- 3000-vs-3000 60-turn raids are STRUCTURALLY drawish once both trade
  once (neither can afford wave 3) — first strike needs 2v1 (5000+ pop).
  A>E at parity = disruption (t5 mid-field settler kill measured), not
  takes; takes need force advantage (pair model). Elo all-fail is honest.
- Expander ships WITHOUT evac (character: accepts decapitation, wins by
  spread; guard + lineage suffice).

### Greedy — viability, recycle, shared home defense (2026-09-04)
Fast: skip_thin 2116→3467 (map redesigned twice: timing alone can't price
restraint — scarcity can: one army, near decoy, far prize; baseline wastes
the only army on rubble 1727), recycle 3592→4086 (latent bug: moves stage
never called note_move so settlers sat on sites — now they BUILD),
raid_hold 3176 (~flat, correct).
Elo: tie cluster intact (greedy 1515); only-vs-expander takes everywhere.
Doctrine learned:
- Single-thin-town maps can't separate (all options ~2100-2300 at any
horizon: denial value offsets; post-starve settling catches up).
- Viability-gating attacks removes accidental defense (t4 counter-march
intercepted wave 2 mid-field; gated version settles and dies t8) — every
raider needs home-hold + second-wave watch to compensate.
- Shared defense factored into common.py: inbound_eta (nearest-own-town
prediction, guards excluded), note_wave_watch (vanished-army memory),
should_hold_home (keep >=1). Ported to aggressive (replacing its inline
version, same numbers).

### Aggressive — viability, departure-sync, home defense (2026-09-04)
Fast: pair 3782→4317 (clean 2v1, guard dies alone), trap 2306→4039
(map redesigned: thin decoy + fat prize; gate skips rubble, takes 4000),
viable 3771 (holds). Elo 1487→1514; all raids vs expander succeed (A>E),
all raids vs turtle fail (T>A), tie cluster with pro/greedy.
Doctrine learned:
- Viability gate (halve-vs-floor+200) first misfired as pure restraint
  (old trap: 2310 vs 2314 — timing wash); redesigned map proves selection.
- Arrival-sync is unworkable (1-turn decision + 1-turn messenger lag +
  stale intel vs 50km/turn; creep evaluated on corpses; halt ordered
  settles; dual gates deadlocked). Departure-sync works: lone army holds
  while home town can retrench (pop ≥ 2x cost), releases with the pack.
- A1 nearly broke defense (chasing ghosts left cap empty, t8 walk-in):
  home-hold vs predicted inbound + second-wave watch (vanished known
  army → hold one home 6 turns; bot-side memory on state object).
- Stationary guards are not inbound (pair freeze: 5105 hoard scored well
  for doing nothing — excluded guards on own towns from inbound).
- Cross-bot coupling is normal: turtle_defend 2547↔1109 swings came from
  B-side changes (both hold); wake 1527→527 honest (B hunts settler now).
  Suicide-evac gated to pop ≥ 2x cost (turtle tweak).

### Turtle — threat defense + MOVE_CAPITAL evac (2026-09-04)
Fast: defend 548→2547 (HOLDS), wake 0→1527 (evac lineage), cluster 2730→2182.
Slow: Elo turtle 1456→? (all raids vs turtle now fail — T>A edge live);
outsettle turtle-side livelier (re-baseline below).
Doctrine learned (all measured, kept only what scored):
- Threat-responsive train bar (2600 peace / 1700 ≤10 / 1200 ≤4) gated by
  can_train_here bypass (its 2600 veto blocked everything — first fix that
  moved nothing until bypassed).
- Per-town threat via target prediction (enemy marches at MY town nearest
  to IT). Global threat made the cap spend on fights aimed elsewhere;
  reading stated targets fails (intel delay); proximity alone misfires.
- Cap-concentration: split garrisons 1635 vs 2180 concentrated (2v1 wins,
  1v1s trade — combat rule).
- Recall settlers to cap (2v1 assembly) unless hopeless; hopeless → lineage
  (settle) instead of trickling into lost trades.
- Threatened home armies hold (never dispatch, never disband into towns).
- MOVE_CAPITAL evac when hopeless + pop ≥ 1000: viceroy founds new capital
  (wake 527→1527). Evac gate hopeless-ONLY (eta≤4 fled winnable fights).
- Peacetime picket: single-town factions train one blind army; multi-town
  hoard until threats show (stops t1+t2 double-tap, restores cluster hoard).
- Cluster 2730→2182 accepted: baseline held by accident (B wave2 died on a
  settler); 2182 holds by design (t12 garrison). Counter-raid doctrine
  (take B's emptied capital) is the future fix. No regressions elsewhere.

### Forecast-at-arrival train gate — tried, REVERTED (2026-09-04)
Replaced the 400/turn distance fudge in `can_train_here` / greedy / pro /
turtle-relaxed with `forecast_pop` (measured growth over intel + messenger
legs) + a 1500 survive floor. Unit-correct, bench-negative, reverted same day.
Fast suite (current tree): pair 4303→3773, trap 4040→3463, viable 3768→3233,
chain 4319→3773, raid_hold 3173→2643, skip_thin 3467→2887, endgame 4928→2000
(uniform ~-530; single-town scenarios flat; wake/defense stayed 0).
Same-spawn-count autopsy (viable 4v4): the gate didn't add trains, it moved
them earlier — distant conquests cleared 1600 instead of 2133, pulling
-500 train→build cycles inside the scoring window.
Doctrine learned:
- Affordability != desirability. The fudge was load-bearing as a spending
  brake: at 1-5 pop/turn growth, a 1000-pop train repays over hundreds of
  turns, so earlier distant trains lose at every horizon tested (80 AND
  1500 turns). Gating *whether* to train needs demand (targets/threats/
  settler pipeline), not just arrival math — that doctrine is still open.
- Delayed intel can't be outgrown: wake stayed 0 because 4-turn growth
  (~+4) can't close 100+ intel gaps at 1200-2600 bars. Stale-threshold
  scenarios need risk posture, not arithmetic.
- Attribution hygiene held: stashed campaign code reproduces the old table
  exactly, isolating all movement to post-campaign engine changes
  (delayed intel moved defense 1109→0, wake 1060→0, endgame 3249→4928 —
  separate ledger to settle).
